Complete analysis of 4 different text types with reasoning and alternatives.

## Example 1: Marketing Copy (English-Turkish)

### Original Text
```
Stop leaving money on the table. Our AI-powered tool finds hidden revenue opportunities your competitors are missing. Join 10,000+ businesses that increased their revenue by 40% in just 90 days.
```

### Analysis
- **Category:** Marketing/Persuasive
- **Tone:** Urgent, confident, action-oriented
- **Target Audience:** Business owners/entrepreneurs
- **Key Phrases:** "money on table", "hidden opportunities", "40% increase", "90 days"
- **Idiom Issues:** "Leaving money on the table" has no direct Turkish equivalent

---

### ❌ BAD Translation (Literal)

```
Masada para bırakmayı durdurun. Yapay zeka-destekli aracımız rakiplerinizin kaçırdığı gizli gelir fırsatlarını bulur. Sadece 90 günde gelirlerini %40 artıran 10.000+ işletmeye katılın.
```

**Problems:**
- "Masada para bırakmayı durdurun" is nonsensical in Turkish (literal word-for-word)
- "Yapay zeka-destekli" is awkward (hyphenation not natural)
- Tone is wooden and mechanical
- Doesn't match persuasive urgency of original

---

### ✅ GOOD Translation (Meaning-Focused)

```
Gözünüzün önündeki fırsatları kaçırmayın. Yapay zeka destekli aracımız, rakiplerinizin göremediği gelir fırsatlarını ortaya çıkarıyor. 90 günde gelirini %40 artıran 10.000'den fazla işletme arasına katılın.
```

**Why Better:**
- "Gözünüzün önündeki fırsatları kaçırmayın" = Turkish idiom meaning "don't miss opportunities in front of you"
- "Yapay zeka destekli" = more natural spacing
- "Ortaya çıkarıyor" = stronger verb, more persuasive
- "10.000'den fazla işletme arasına katılın" = better call-to-action
- Maintains urgency and persuasiveness of original

### Original Text
```

```

### Analysis
- **Category:** Technical/Documentation
- **Tone:** Instructional, clear, formal
- **Target Audience:** Developers/technical users

---

```

**Translation Decisions:**
- "Webhook'u" → Turkish spelling with accusative case ending
- "yapılandırmak" → "configure" translated
- "Ayarlar > Entegrasyonlar > Webhooks" → Menu path kept as-is (user sees English in UI)

### Original Text
```
Look, I get it. You've tried everything. The diets, the apps, the 5 AM workouts that lasted exactly three days. Been there, done that, got the unused gym membership to prove it.
```

### Analysis
- **Category:** Casual/Personal narrative
- **Tone:** Friendly, understanding, slightly self-deprecating humor
- **Target Audience:** General readers (not formal)
- **Addressing:** "You" should become "sen" (informal) in Turkish
- **Idiom:** "Been there, done that" needs Turkish equivalent

---

### ✅ GOOD Translation

```
Bakın, anlıyorum. Her şeyi denediniz. Diyetler, uygulamalar, tam üç gün süren sabah 5 antrenmanları... Hepsinden geçtim, kullanılmamış spor salonu üyeliğim şahit.
```

**Translation Decisions:**
- "Look, I get it" → "Bakın, anlıyorum" (friendly, understanding)
- "You've tried everything" → "Her şeyi denediniz" (but later becomes "sen" context)
- "Been there, done that" → "Hepsinden geçtim" (Turkish idiom meaning same thing)
- "Got the unused gym membership to prove it" → "kullanılmamış spor salonu üyeliğim şahit" (poetic, humorous)

## Example 4: Humor & Irony (English-Turkish)

"Just one more episode" I said, 4 hours ago, as I started my 47th rewatch of The Office.
```

### Analysis
- **Category:** Humor/Irony
- **Tone:** Self-aware, humorous, relatable
- **Humor Type:** Ironic exaggeration (common streaming experience)
- **Challenge:** Keeping humor intact while translating
- **Key Element:** Contrast between "just one more" and "47th rewatch"

---

### ❌ MEDIOCRE Translation (Loses Humor)

```
"Son bir bölüm daha" dedim, 4 saat önce, The Office'in 47. kez baştan izlemesine başlarken.
```

**Problem:** Technically correct but humor lost. Reads like a simple statement, not humorous/ironic.

---

### ✅ GOOD Translation (Preserves Humor)

```
"Son bir bölüm daha" dedim, 4 saat önce. The Office'i 47. kez baştan izlemeye başlarken.
```

**OR**

```
"Son bölümü izleyeceğim" dedim 4 saat önce. The Office'in 47. turunu başlayırken. (Evet, 47'nci.)
```

**Why Better:**
- Broken sentence structure mimics the irony
- Unexpected time jump (4 hours later) creates humor
- "47th rewatch" detail makes irony clear
- Maintains self-aware tone
- Works across time and culture (streaming is universal)

---

### Alternative Turkish Versions

**Version 1 (Literal but works):**
```
"Son bir bölüm daha" dedim 4 saat önce. The Office'i 47. kez baştan izlemeye başlarken.
```
✓ Simple, clear, humor intact through context

**Version 2 (More emphasis):**
```
"Sadece son bölüm" dedim, 4 saat önce. The Office'in 47. kez izlenmesini başlattığımda.
```
✓ "Sadece" (just) emphasizes irony

**Version 3 (Localized):**
```
"Son sezon daha izleyeyim" dedim, 4 saat önce. The Office'i 47. defa seyretmeye başlarken.
```
✓ If localizing to Turkish popular shows

| Awkward phrasing | Rewrite naturally | Sounds like native speaker |
| Format changes | Preserve structure | Keep bold, lists, spacing |
| Made-up terms | Use standard equivalents | Follow industry standards |

## How to Evaluate Your Own Translations

### The "Invisible Translator" Test
Read your translation. If you notice you're reading a *translation*, it failed.

### The "Read-Back" Test
Read original, then translation. Do they convey the exact same idea, tone, and emotion?

### The "Native Speaker" Test
Would a native speaker of target language think "this was originally written in my language"?

### The "Swap" Test
If you swapped original and translation, would someone notice it's the "wrong" way?

**If you pass all four tests = Good translation.**

```

**Russian Grammar - Gender & Aspect:**
