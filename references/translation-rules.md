# Translation Rules - All Language Pairs

## Universal Principles (Apply to All Language Pairs)

### 1. Meaning Over Words ✓
Translate the **meaning and intent**, not individual words.

| ❌ Literal | ✅ Meaning-Focused |
|-----------|------------------|
| "I'm over the moon" → "Ayın üzerindeyim" (Turkish) | "I'm over the moon" → "Çok mutluyum" (Turkish) |
| "Break a leg" → "Bacağını kır" (Turkish) | "Break a leg" → "Başarılar!" (Turkish) |
| "Piece of cake" → "Bir parça kek" (Turkish) | "Piece of cake" → "Çocuk oyuncağı" (Turkish) |

### 2. Natural Language Output
Translated text should read as if a native speaker wrote it originally—not like a translation.

| ❌ Unnatural | ✅ Natural |
|-------------|-----------|
| "This feature very useful is" | "This feature is very useful" |
| "Game-changer este es" (Spanish) | "Esto cambia las reglas del juego" (Spanish) |
| "Yapay zeka-tarafından desteklenen" (Turkish) | "Yapay zeka destekli" (Turkish) |

### 3. Tone Preservation
Maintain the **exact tone and emotional intent** of the original:
- Professional → Professional
- Casual → Casual
- Humorous → Humorous
- Urgent → Urgent
- Sarcastic → Sarcastic

**Example:**
Original (casual, friendly): "Hey, just a heads up that..."
Translation (should also be casual/friendly, not formal)

### 4. Format Integrity
**Never** alter structure:
- Headers stay headers
- Lists stay lists
- Paragraphs stay paragraphs
- Bold stays bold
- Italics stay italics
- Code blocks stay code blocks (code itself never translated)

### 5. No Additions
Never add information, explanations, or context not in the original.

### 6. No Omissions
Never remove or skip information from the original.

## Primary Rules for Each Language Pair

### English-Turkish

#### Rule 1: Grammatical Accuracy
- Use correct case endings (-i, -ı, -u, -ü for accusative case)
- Apply present continuous (-iyor) for ongoing actions
- Use proper possessive suffixes
- Maintain subject-verb agreement

**Example:**
- "I love automation" → "Otomasyonu seviyorum" (not "Seviyorum otomasyonu")
- Direct object (otomasyonu) must take accusative case

#### Rule 2: Addressing & Formality (sen/siz)
Consistency is KEY. Choose once, stick throughout.

```
Context → Decision
├── Formal/Corporate → "siz" (formal you)
├── Tutorial/How-to → Usually "siz" or imperative
├── Casual/Blog → "sen" (informal you)
├── General statement → Avoid pronoun, use passive or infinitive
└── Ambiguous → Default to "siz" (more respectful)
```

#### Rule 3: Technical Terms
| Term Type | Approach | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Established Turkish equivalent | Use Turkish | "Software" → "Yazılım" |
| Industry standard in English | Keep English | "Workflow" → "Workflow" |
| Mixed usage | First occurrence explain both | "API (Uygulama Programlama Arayüzü)" |
| New/niche term | Context-dependent | "Prompt engineering" → "Prompt mühendisliği" veya olduğu gibi |

#### Rule 4: Abbreviations & Acronyms
- International standard (HTML, API, CEO) → Keep as-is
- Turkish equivalent common (UN → BM) → Translate
- Mixed usage → First occurrence with explanation

#### Rule 5: Numbers & Measurements
- Currency: Adapt to local context ("$100" → "100 dolar" or "~3000 TL")
- Measurements: Convert to metric if appropriate
- Dates: Use local format ("12/25/2024" → "25 Aralık 2024")
- Time: Use 24-hour or clarify AM/PM

#### Rule 6: Idioms & Expressions
Always find meaning equivalent, never literal translation.

| English Idiom | ❌ Literal | ✅ Turkish Equivalent |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| "Spill the beans" | "Fasulyeleri dök" | "Ağzından kaçır" / "İfşa et" |
| "Cost an arm and a leg" | "Kol ve bacak maliyeti" | "Göz çıkardı" / "Servet eder" |
| "It's raining cats and dogs" | "Kedi köpek yağıyor" | "Bardaktan boşanırcasına yağıyor" |

**Example:** If perfect grammar conflicts with natural tone, choose natural tone and note the decision.
