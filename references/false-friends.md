## 🔴 CRITICAL FALSE FRIENDS (Most Dangerous)

### The "Embarrassed/Pregnant" Group
These will get you in trouble if you mix them up:

**Spanish:**
- ❌ "embarazada" ≠ embarrassed → **PREGNANT**
- ✅ "avergonzada" = embarrassed

**Portuguese:**
- ❌ "embaraçada" ≠ embarrassed → **PREGNANT/AWKWARD**
- ✅ "envergonhada" = embarrassed/ashamed

**Italian:**
- ❌ "constipato" ≠ constipated → **CONGESTED/STUFFED UP**
- ✅ "stitico" = constipated

### The "Condom" Group
Romance languages love this one:

**Spanish/Portuguese/Italian/Russian:**
- **preservativo** = CONDOM (not food preservative!)
- Use "conservante" (Spanish) or "aditivo" for food preservative

### The "Cold" Group
- **Spanish:** "constipado" = HAS A COLD
- **Portuguese:** "constipado" = HAS A COLD
- **Italian:** "constipato" = CONGESTED/STUFFY

### The "Currently" Group
- **Spanish:** "actualmente" = CURRENTLY/NOWADAYS (not "actually")
- **Portuguese:** "atualmente" = CURRENTLY (not "actually")

## 🎯 PREVENTION STRATEGY

1. **Learn in Context** - Don't learn words in isolation!
2. **Create Associations** - Link false friends to their real meaning
3. **Use Mnemonics** - Make up memory tricks:
   - "EMBarazo = BABY" (Spanish embarazada = pregnant)
   - "CoNSTipado = NOSE/COLD" (not digestive system!)
4. **Practice With Examples** - Use real sentences, not just word lists
5. **Cross-Check** - Always verify against context before translating

---

## ✅ BEST PRACTICES

When you encounter a word that looks familiar:
1. **STOP** - Don't assume it means the same as English
2. **VERIFY** - Check the context and meaning
3. **CONFIRM** - Look up in a reliable dictionary
4. **TEST** - Use in a sentence to make sure it makes sense
5. **REMEMBER** - Add to your personal false friends list

---

**Pro Tip:** The most dangerous false friends are those that are partially correct. For example, "sensible" in French DOES mean something about sense/feeling - it just means "sensitive" not "sensible." Always check!
