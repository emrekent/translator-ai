# Quality Control Checklist

Apply this checklist **after each translation** to ensure highest quality across all language pairs.

## Pre-Translation Preparation

- [ ] Read entire source text completely
- [ ] Understand context and purpose
- [ ] Identify text category (Technical/Marketing/Casual/Formal/Creative)
- [ ] Note tone and emotional intent
- [ ] Review target language rules for this language pair
- [ ] Identify any special cases (idioms, cultural refs, technical terms)
- [ ] Decide on formality level (and commit to it)

## Mandatory Post-Translation Controls ✓

These checks apply to ALL translations, ALL language pairs.

### 1. Meaning Preservation Test
- [ ] Every piece of information from original is present
- [ ] No information added that wasn't in original
- [ ] Meaning is identical (if translated back, same understanding)
- [ ] Nuance and subtext preserved

**Test:** Read original and translation side-by-side. Do they convey the exact same idea?

### 2. Tone Preservation Test
- [ ] Original tone matches translation tone
- [ ] If original is professional → translation is professional
- [ ] If original is casual → translation is casual
- [ ] If original is humorous → translation is still funny (or notes why it doesn't work)
- [ ] Emotional intent intact

**Test:** Read translation. Does it *feel* like the original?

### 3. Completeness Test (Nothing Missing)
- [ ] No sentences accidentally omitted
- [ ] No paragraphs skipped
- [ ] No details left out
- [ ] All emphasis (bold, italics, etc.) preserved

**Test:** Count sentences/sections in original vs. translation. Should match.

### 4. No Additions Test
- [ ] No explanations added
- [ ] No extra information inserted
- [ ] No translator commentary (unless specifically requested)
- [ ] No "helpful" expansions

**Test:** Translator should be invisible. Reader shouldn't know text was translated.

### 5. Format Integrity Test
- [ ] All headers preserved
- [ ] All lists maintained (bullet points or numbering)
- [ ] All paragraph breaks in same places
- [ ] Bold formatting retained
- [ ] Italic formatting retained
- [ ] Code blocks untouched
- [ ] Line breaks preserved (if important)
- [ ] Indentation maintained (if important)

**Test:** Visual structure of translation should match original.

### 6. Consistency Test
- [ ] Same terms used consistently throughout
- [ ] Formality level (sen/siz, tú/usted, tu/vous, du/Sie) consistent
- [ ] Same word choices for repeated concepts
- [ ] Acronyms translated consistently (or kept consistently)

**Test:** Search same word/concept in translation. Should be translated same way each time.

### 7. Naturalness Test
- [ ] Translation reads like native speaker wrote it
- [ ] No awkward phrasing that "sounds translated"
- [ ] Natural word order for target language
- [ ] Appropriate idioms and expressions used
- [ ] Doesn't sound mechanical or word-by-word

**Test:** Have you read translations that "sound like translations"? This shouldn't be one.

## Optional Controls (Use for Complex Content)

Apply these when translation is complex, technical, or high-stakes.

### 8. Technical Accuracy (Technical Content)
- [ ] All technical terms correct and consistent
- [ ] Terminology matches industry standards
- [ ] Acronyms and abbreviations correct
- [ ] Units of measurement converted properly (if applicable)
- [ ] Numbers and calculations preserved

**When to use:** Software documentation, medical translations, legal documents, technical manuals.

### 9. Cultural Appropriateness (All Content)
- [ ] No offensive terms or expressions
- [ ] Cultural references adapted appropriately
- [ ] Idioms make sense in target culture
- [ ] Humor works in target culture (or noted)
- [ ] Formal levels appropriate to culture

**When to use:** Marketing content, cultural content, international communications.

### 10. Grammar & Language Rules (All Content)
- [ ] All grammar rules for target language followed
- [ ] Subject-verb agreement correct
- [ ] Case systems correct (Turkish, German, French gender/case)
- [ ] Verb conjugations accurate
- [ ] Pronouns correct and consistent

**When to use:** Always, but prioritize when formality/register matters.

### 11. Readability & Flow (All Content)

- [ ] Sentence rhythm natural
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity

- [ ] Transitions feel natural

**When to use:** Marketing copy, blog posts, persuasive content, user-facing text.

## Quick Reference Checklist (Short Version)

## Escalation Rules

If ANY of these is true, mark for review:

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Ambiguous original text | Add translator's note explaining choice |
| Idiom/humor doesn't translate | Offer alternative or explain why it's challenging |
| Technical terminology uncertain | Flag and propose best option + rationale |
| Cultural reference unclear | Add brief explanation |
| Grammar rule conflicts with natural output | Note the decision and why |
| Multiple equally valid translations | Present primary choice + alternatives |

## Quality Metrics for Each Language Pair

### Track These to Ensure Continuous Improvement

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Meaning Preservation | 100% | Spot check: back-translate 5% of content |
| Naturalness Rating | 4.5/5 | Peer review or user feedback |
| Terminology Consistency | 100% | Search repeated terms; verify consistency |
| Format Integrity | 100% | Visual comparison original vs. translation |
| Cultural Appropriateness | 100% | Review for offensive/inappropriate content |
| Grammar Accuracy | 100% | Grammar check (native speaker preferred) |
| Tone Match | 95%+ | Subjective assessment |

## When to Ask for Human Review

Consider human/native speaker review when:

- [ ] Translation is for public-facing/marketing purposes
- [ ] Translation is legal, medical, or highly technical
- [ ] Translation will reach native speakers (quality matters more)
- [ ] New language pair (before it's marked "production-ready")
- [ ] Any language pair has low confidence history
- [ ] Special formatting or cultural nuance critical
- [ ] High stakes (business contracts, medical records, etc.)

## Documentation of Decisions

When you override a rule or make a non-obvious choice, document:

**Format:**
```
Decision: [What you chose]
Reason: [Why you chose it]
Alternative: [What you could have chosen]
Justification: [Why your choice is better]
```

**Example:**
```
Decision: "Otomasyonu seviyorum" (I love automation)
Reason: Akkusatif durum gerekli (Turkish grammar)
Alternative: "Otomasyona sevgim var" (I have love for automation)
Justification: First option more natural, matches tone of original
```

This helps:
1. Show your reasoning
2. Track improvements over time
3. Train others on your decision-making
4. Build skill knowledge base
